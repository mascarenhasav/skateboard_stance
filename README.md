# SKATEBOARDING STANCE AND HANDEDNESS: A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF RELATIONSHIP, PROPORTIONS AND INFLUENCES


The aim of this paper is to show the relationship that lies in the fact of a person being right
or left handed, in their skateboarding stance. Starting from the null hypothesis that there is no relationship,
the Pearson’s χ2 with Yates correction tests, as well as its respective p-value will be used to test the hypothesis.
It will also be calculated and analyzed the residuals, Cramer’s V and the Risk and Odds Ratios, with their
respective confidence intervals to know the intensity of the association.
